This is a loose collection of notes (and embedded mini-software progarms) about things that I find interesting about the [FNV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function) family of hash functions.

These notes may contain mini-software notes; any software programs or snippets of code appearing in notes in this repository are licensed under the ISC license.
